# DigNet
DigNet is a neural network that can be trained, using reinforcement learning, to solve a traveling salesman problem of sorts where the objective is for an agent to find an optimal path through a grid world where the objective is to visit sites of interest and perform actions at each site to minimize the number of steps taken.

The inspiration behind this project is the Mars Perseverance rover, which has a mission to search for signs of ancient life. I imagine such an agent trained with RL could be useful in programming what the rover's daily schedule should be in order to optimize travel time.

I've tried a variety of different approaches to find an optimal solution to this, with the most optimal being found in gym_digger_dqn_keras-rl2.py.
